# Case-Converter-JavaScript
Made as a project within the Hyperskill.org platform.

Nothing more than a simple project in JavaScript, touches upon event handling for pressing buttons as well ass modyfing strings with the help of DOM manipulation. When a button is pressed the text inside of a text area has it's casing changed to upper, lower, scentence and proper casing. Users can also download the text inside of the textarea as a .txt file.
